- **TSDB** 'Time-Series DataBase'
-----
## 3) What is the difference between different metrics types ( counter, gauge, histogram)?
### **counter** :
- 'How many?'
- **Counter** is a fundamental way for tracking how often an event occurs within an application or service.
- An example of a counter metric is http_requests_total, which reports the running total of HTTP requests to an endpoint on an application or service.
### **gauge** :
- 'Current state of events'
- are used to periodically take measurements or snapshots of a metric at a single point in time.

### **histogram** :
- 'How long?'
- A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.
